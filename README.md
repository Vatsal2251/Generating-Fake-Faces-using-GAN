## About the Project

GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other in a game. This project focuses on generating high-quality images of human faces by training a GAN on a dataset of celebrity faces.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Without Mask]([http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/face-mask-lite-dataset)), which contains over 10,000 face images with annotations.
